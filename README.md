# Fantasy Premier League Points Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Aim
The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the number of points a player will get each week on the popular fantasy football website, https://fantasy.premierleague.com/. I plan to test a variety of machine learning models, both regressions and classifiers.

## Background
Fantatsy Premier League (FPL) is an online game where players create a virtual team consisting of players from the English Premier League. The aim of the game is to accumulate as many points as possible based on the performance of these players in real-life matches throughout the season.

## Data

I have used 3 principle sources of Data covering the past 3 seasons.

### Player Level Data
1. FPL  (Credit to https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League for the data)
- 70 660  observations, 64 variables

2. Understat (Web scrapping) - https://understat.com
- 70 361 observations,  22 variables

### Team Level Data
1. FiveThirtyEight (API) - https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-api/club/spi_matches.csv
- 2660 observations, 23 variables
